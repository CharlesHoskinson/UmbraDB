/**
 * The real ingestion/sync service that populates the `chain_archive` schema from a live Midnight
 * node (JSON-RPC, raw block bytes) and indexer (GraphQL, structured transaction metadata) --
 * `design/full-chain-storage-design.md`'s Tier-1.5 archive, made real per this implementation
 * sprint's task.
 *
 * **Dependency shape, stated precisely (Sol-audit fix round, Finding 7 -- an earlier version of
 * this comment overclaimed "interface injection")**: this module directly imports and constructs
 * the concrete `PgChainArchiveStore` (`src/postgres/chain-archive-store.ts`) in its constructor,
 * and imports the `UmbraDBSql` type from `src/postgres/client.ts` -- there is no runtime
 * dependency injection of the store. `ChainArchiveStore`
 * (`src/interfaces/chain-archive-store.ts`) serves as a TYPE-ONLY contract: the `store` field is
 * typed against the interface, so everything after construction goes through the interface
 * surface, but the implementation choice is hard-wired here, not injected by the caller. That is
 * an allowed, deliberate arrangement -- the architectural boundary (AC-7) is DIRECTIONAL:
 * `chain-archive-sync/* -> src/postgres/*` is the permitted direction, and what the guard
 * (`test/postgres/no-chain-sync-import-guard.test.ts`) enforces is that `src/*` never imports
 * anything from this directory back.
 *
 * **Judgment call, documented (no design-doc precedent covers this exactly)**: the node's
 * `chain_getBlock` JSON-RPC response does not hand back literal on-wire SCALE bytes for the
 * header as a single blob (Substrate's JSON-RPC layer decodes the header into named fields
 * before returning it) -- there is no `chain_getHeaderBytes`-equivalent call. This service
 * content-addresses a **canonical JSON serialization of exactly what the node authoritatively
 * returned** for `header` (`headerBytes`) and for the `extrinsics` array (`bodyBytes`) as the
 * "raw" payload chain_blobs stores for those two roles -- deterministic, reconstructable byte-
 * for-byte from what the node handed back, hash-verified on every read (AC-3), but NOT a
 * from-scratch re-implementation of Substrate's own header SCALE codec. Each individual
 * transaction's `tx_raw` blob, by contrast, IS real on-wire bytes straight from the indexer's
 * `Transaction.raw` field, not a JSON reconstruction -- but (a second empirical judgment call,
 * see `ingestTransactionsForBlock`'s own doc below for the full byte-level finding) it is the
 * INNER opaque `pallet_midnight::send_mn_transaction` payload specifically, not the node's outer
 * per-extrinsic SCALE envelope bytes (confirmed live: the indexer's `raw` is an exact suffix of
 * the corresponding node extrinsic's bytes, not byte-identical to it) -- cross-checked below by
 * substring containment against the node's own block body, not by exact-string membership.
 */

 *  top-level ones `JSON.stringify(value, Object.keys(...).sort())` alone would cover -- header/

   *
   * **Two judgment calls, both discovered empirically against the real devnet, neither assumed
   * in advance:**
   *
   * 1. The node's `chain_getBlock` `extrinsics` count is NOT always equal to the indexer's
   *    per-block `transactions` count for the SAME block -- confirmed live on genesis (height
   *    0): the node reports 28 raw extrinsics, the indexer reports 26 transactions. The two
   *    extra node-side extrinsics are Substrate-framework-level (an inherent such as
   *    `Timestamp::set`, and/or a consensus-related extrinsic) that never get wrapped as a
   *    `pallet_midnight` ledger transaction at all -- the indexer's `Transaction` entity is
   *    specifically scoped to `pallet_midnight`'s own transactions, not literally every SCALE
   *    extrinsic in the block body.
   * 2. A node extrinsic's raw bytes are NOT byte-equal to the indexer's `Transaction.raw` for
   *    the same logical transaction, even when one genuinely corresponds to the other --
   *    confirmed live on genesis tx 0: the indexer reports `raw = "6d69646e...4a7e8d03"` (42
   *    bytes, begins with the ASCII `midnight:system-transaction[v6]:` tag per §3.2 of
   *    `design/full-chain-storage-design.md`), while the node's corresponding extrinsic is
   *    `0xb4050600a4` + THAT SAME 42-byte string (47 bytes) -- the extra 5-byte prefix is the
   *    outer Substrate extrinsic envelope (length/version/call-index framing around
   *    `pallet_midnight::send_mn_transaction`'s own `Vec<u8>` argument), which the node's RPC
   *    layer does not strip but the indexer's `raw` field already does (it stores the INNER
   *    opaque payload, not the outer extrinsic). Confirmed by direct byte inspection, not
   *    inferred: the indexer's reported bytes are an exact SUFFIX of the corresponding node
   *    extrinsic's bytes, not an equal string.
   *
   * Both findings are why this cross-check is CONTAINS (`node extrinsic bytes include indexer's
   * reported raw bytes as a substring`), not an exact-match membership or positional check: this
   * is the correct, real relationship between the two data sources, not a loosened check for its
   * own sake. It still proves the property this cross-check exists to establish -- the indexer's
   * reported bytes genuinely originate from this block's real body, not a stale/wrong value --
   * without requiring the two lists to be the same length, in the same order, or byte-identical
   * at the outer-envelope level. `position` is taken from the INDEXER's own transaction ordering
   * (stable, and what a `tx_hash`-based lookup actually needs to disambiguate multiple
   * transactions in one block), not the node's raw extrinsic index.
